# Simon-Says Game

This project is a simple browser-based **Simon-Says Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The user has to follow and repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order, which becomes progressively longer with each level.

## Game Preview

The game consists of four colored buttons:
- **Red**
- **Yellow**
- **Green**
- **Purple**

On each level, the game shows a random sequence of button flashes. The player needs to reproduce the same sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order. The game continues to the next level if the sequence is entered correctly.

### Game Features
- The sequence of colors increases with each level.
- Visual feedback is provided by flashing buttons.
- Game-over screen when the user selects the wrong button in the sequence.
- Score is displayed as the current level.
